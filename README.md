electricimp-experiments
=======================

A small project was created in which an electric imp was connected to a sonar range finder, and the results of this range finder were fed through the electric imp system and into spacebrew through the http_link.js tool.

Electric Imp projects consist of code and a planer.  The code creates these in/out objects, and the planer is used to connect these objects.  Unfurtonately the Electric Imp website does not allow you to share projects, and so this repository was created.

In order to recreate this project.

1) Find the electric imp sonar detector that should be in the lab somewhere
2) Run the http_link spacebrew tool on top of a spacebrew server
3) Copy the source code from imp.code into an imp code project
4) Create a planner, and follow the images from planner.png and planner1.png to configure route
5) Do stuff w/ the data!
